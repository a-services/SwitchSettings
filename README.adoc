Utility to switch backend environments within jQM project in link:https://appery.io[Appery.io].


It can be started with one parameter to switch `Settings` item in jQM project to `env`:

```
aset env
```

See <<project_setup>> for details.

Or it can be started with two parameters to compare `env1` and `env2` environments:

```
aset env1 env2
```

See <<comparing_environments>> for details.

NOTE: link:https://java.com[Java] should be installed on your computer to run this utility.

== aset.properties

`aset.properties` is a configuration file where you can provide your username/password
for link:https://appery.io[Appery.io]
as well as the name of jQM project.

You can also turn database and server-code verifications `on` or `off` here to
affect <<comparing_environments>> procedure.

[[project_setup]]
== jQM project setup

This utility expects all environment-related properties to be placed into `Setting_env` items, where `env` is the
name of environment, like `Prod` or `Dev`. There also should be basic `Setting` item with the same set of properties.

Utility started as `aset dev` will replace properties in `Setting` item with values from `Setting_Dev`,
making jQM project to use `Dev` environment.

Utility started as `aset prod` will replace properties in `Setting` item with values from `Setting_Prod`,
making jQM project to use `Prod` environment.

CAUTION: Be sure to create a version of jQM project in Appery before switching the environments
to be able to rollback the changes.

[[comparing_environments]]
== Comparing environments

While implementing the new features you can work on your backend changes in `Dev` environment.
After the changes are tested good enough, you can move them to `Prod` environment, copying
them manually from changed `Dev` server-codes and database.

To ensure that all changes are copied properly you can run `aset dev prod` command to compare `Dev` and `Prod`
backend environments. It will perform the checks to ensure that:

- both databases have the same set of collections
- every collection has the same set of fields
- server-code sources are identical (though we expect them to use different libraries in `Dependencies` to point at different databases)
